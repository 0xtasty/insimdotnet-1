# InSim.NET Core

**Note - this library may not be stable.**

This is a quick and dirty port of InSim.NET to .NET Core. Anything not compatible was stripped out or reworked without a huge amount of testing, also a lot of Windows specific stuff had to be removed. However, it should work OK and provides a base for things moving forward.

The [exsting documentation](https://github.com/alexmcbride/insimdotnet/wiki) should still be valid.
